  <center><p class='Opis'>The event, which got name "the Chernobyl Disaster”, has changed the trajectory of our civilization development; it is the most evident contribution of Ukraine into the global history. Its place – the Chernobyl Zone, with the nuclear power plant (NPP), which doesn’t produce energy anymore but instead paradoxically consumes it, and an abandoned ghost town of Pripyat, – like a time machine, let you see the events past and realize how both history and nature works. The intricate ensemble of hundreds of impressive technical and cultural monuments is surrounded and engulfed by flourishing nature, which has gone wild in this area.</p></center>
